# Time Series Analysis and Forecasting using ARIMA Model

The aim of this project is to perform Time Series Analysis on the given Super Store dataset and Forecast the sales of Furniture using the ARIMA model.

Time Series forecasting models are the models that are capable to predict future values based on previously observed values.

A widely used method for time series prediction is the AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average(ARIMA) model. ARIMA model assumes that the historic values dictate behaviour of present. 

In this project, data for Furniture sales is considered and analysed.The trend, seasonality and noise for data is checked using Decomposition method and whether the data is stationary or not is decided by the Augmented Decay Fuller Test. ARIMA model is then built to forecast the furniture sales for a period 2017-12-01 to 2018-12-01.
